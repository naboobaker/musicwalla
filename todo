To Do
=====

Sourcecode
- Make common code common in javascript - such as common dynamic table
- audio_player.js is big and needs to be simplified/shortened
- Change JS generated table bodies to generate full table (header/body/etc)

Controllers
- look into respond_with instead of respond_to
- check "todo" comments

All UI
- Tooltips over buttons
- Separate styling from HTML -> move to CSS
- Use styling instead of BRs for spacing
- Truncate names in tables if wider than column
- Table row generation is clunky/hard-coded
- Fixed column widths - right now, they dynamicaly change width based on content

Main page
- Good style/UI for main page's current playlist/song

Playlist Editor
- Find better way to generate song form to bind to Rails forms, i.e., using hard-coded "song[song_attribute][x][name]" seems clunky
- When deleting a song, need to properly update x in song[song_attribute][x][name]/[id]/[location]
- Navigating on Back button from Playlist edit page, back to Playlist Manage page - list of Playlists is sometimes stale
